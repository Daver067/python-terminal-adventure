# Plain text adventure challenge

## The pitch

The goal is to make a pure and plain text based game that runs in the terminal.
This is a collaborative adventure, involving two or more creators. The game can
be created in any language, so long as it outputs to terminal.

## Why make this?

It encourages best practices, and keeps it fun Rules are aimed to keep it
small, so it's pretty low stress. No need to manage files, dependencies or
configs It's a creative outlet Variations could be made where some mutually
agreed assets such as packages, databases, and config files are allowed. These
would be starters.

## The Rules

The participants must alternate commits, no two in a row by one person, even
for bug fixes. This puts a bit of pressure to do high quality single commits.
No small change here. One file - A single text file. This is good practice for
code organization, navigating code, and reading others code. Git files are
fine. No images or external files of any kind. No external code packages
either, if we want it we build it. You may only spend 30 minutes on the
computer per commit. Phones count as a computer.
